# ML Training – Day 2

This repository contains my **Machine Learning Day 2 training work**, where I practiced core ML concepts using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Topics Covered

### Linear Regression

* Implemented **Linear Regression** using `scikit-learn`
* Trained model on CSV dataset
* Evaluated predictions

###  Data Visualization

* Used **Matplotlib** for plotting:

  * Line plots
  * Scatter plots
  * Regression lines
* Used **Seaborn** for:

  * Statistical visualizations
  * Enhanced graphs

### Label Encoding

* Converted categorical data into numerical format using:

  * `LabelEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing`
* Prepared data for machine learning models


###  Working with CSV Files

* Loaded dataset using **pandas**
* Performed data preprocessing
* Used CSV file as input for ML models
